# UFOs

### Overview of Project: 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Results: 
Dana might have someone new use her webpage by first discussing their interest in UFOs, otherwise she might not get a bite! Realistically, though Dana would want to walk the user through the multiple filters she has created. With each step down, the user can drill down to specific dates, countries, and shapes. 

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

### Summary: 

* One set back of the new design is no filter button. As per the original design, it gives the user the logical button to press down on, rather than automatically filtering. Just as you do in Google, there is a clear and consice button to hit.

Two Recommendations:
* One recommendation would be to add references or sources to the data. Might help users 


In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
