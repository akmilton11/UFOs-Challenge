# UFOs

### Overview of Project: 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Results: 
Dana might have someone new use her webpage by first discussing their interest in UFOs, otherwise she might not get a bite! Realistically, though Dana would want to walk the user through the multiple filters she has created. With each step down, the user can drill down to specific dates, countries, and shapes. Just enter the criteria and hit enter and watch the data filter!

### Summary: 

#### Set Back
* One set back of the new design is no filter button. As per the original design, it gives the user the logical button to press down on, rather than automatically filtering. Just as you do in Google, there is a clear and concise button to hit. The data seems to disappear when the user is entering the data, that may seem a little strange to a new user.

#### Two Recommendations:
* Dana should add references or sources to the data. Might help users pull up secondary sources to verify the data.
* Dana should add some additional visuals or videos. The webpage is basic, but could use a little love on formatting/aesthetics.
